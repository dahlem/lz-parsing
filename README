This project implements Lempel-Ziv parsing and encoding of input
sequences. This can be used to compress a sequence using a dictionary
that is created online. The Lempel-Ziv type of algorithms underly most
of the compression algorithms.


EXECUTION

The command line parameters are as follows:

General Configuration:
  --help                produce help message
  --version             show the version

I/O Configuration:
  --result arg (=./results) results directory.
  --sequence arg            sequence file.
  --min arg (=1)            minimum elements to be considered in the sequence 
                            for parsing.

LZ Configuration:
  --twopass-parse arg (=0)  parse the sequence twice with offset of 1
  --twopass-encode arg (=0) encode the sequence twice with offset of 1

The sequence file expects three columns separated by commas. The first
column gives the sequence identifier; the second column is a running
integer of the position of a string in the sequence, and the third
column is the string of the sequence. E.g.,

1,1,a
1,2,b
1,3,c
...
1,26,z

is the alphabet given as a sequence.

The LZ configuration provides means to parse and encode the input
sequence twice with an offset of 1 respectively. This can be used to
enrich the dictionary on the one hand side and the encoding on the
other.
